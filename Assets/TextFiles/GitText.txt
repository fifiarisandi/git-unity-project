Welcome to Unity with Git!!!
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Git is (just added this part to modify the text) easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. 

hello git. 
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
Could have more free storage space though...
With github and other version control platforms that use git, we can also automate project deployment and testing using pipeline etc

This is a new Line.
Why hello there. I am currently modifying the existing text by adding more text. I don't have a lot to say right now, however. Have a nice weekend.
Just added an image file.
